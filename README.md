# Connect4
Creating the best Connect 4 AI possible.

Within this repository I create the classic Connect 4 board game in C, before implementing an AI player using the minimax algorithm. I then make both players a minimax AI with their own parameters, and investigate which parameters lead to the best performing AI. This investigation is done using machine learning in Python and R. Lastly, the code is parallelised where possible to allow for more optimal performance. This means the AI can be set to look further ahead in terms of move permutations.
